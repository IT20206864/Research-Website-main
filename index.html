					<p>Down Syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects cognitive, physical, and social development, which has been looked down upon by people in many instances, according to a conducted survey, the Down Syndrome’s Association has published a report for such discrimination, which consist of denial of surgeries, demotivating actions/words for their condition [1]. Amid this condition, there a lot of people with the Down Syndrome disorder who have succeeded their life through proper education. ‘Michael Beynon’ who is an entrepreneur selling his own product, ‘Isabella Tejada’ who is a fashion designer who was also initially rejected by a university for her condition, ‘Steven Brandon’ who is an actor are only a few examples to point out their potential, getting the ability to live a ‘normal life’ through proper education and an inclusive, supportive community [2].
There are a few characteristics of DS disordered people which create a barrier for their education but that could evidently be overcome using proper education methodologies which also could be made to be more effective using ICT. One such hindrance, also the most affecting, is the language barrier. 
Speech and language delays are common characteristics in DS which affects the continuation of education if not properly addressed at an early stage [3]. As ‘Chapman’ has pointed out in his article, vocabulary development is very important as it will have a very significant influence on further educational progress [5].
Children with DS also have difficulty with fine and gross motor skills, making it difficult for them to perform tasks due to factors such as low muscle tone, poor coordination, and difficulties with hand-eye coordination. Fine motor skills involve coordination of small muscle movements, particularly in the hands, like writing and buttoning a shirt. Gross motor skills, on the other hand, require coordination of large muscle groups and result in movements such as walking and running [7]. It is common for children with Down syndrome to progress in their development of fine motor skills in a similar manner as typically developing children, but at a slower rate [8].
 Lower cognitive abilities are another such characteristic, most frequently their IQs show mild to severe impairment [4]. According to one study, DS children’s early childhood IQs ranged from 28 to 71 with an average of 44.7 which causes delays in mathematical understanding, spatial awareness, problem solving [3]. The results of the current study indicate that individuals with Down Syndrome exhibit a decline in intelligence quotient (IQ) as they age compared to typically developing children [6]. 
Although these problems have been identified, there are many institutions that have not got the ability to apply solutions for it through a proper educational methodology for which ICT could be used as a ‘motivating’ factor to make primary education feel like a hobby.

				 <h5><strong>Proposed Solution</strong></h5>
				 </br>
				 <p style="text-align: justify;"> The system proposed in this research project addresses this barrier by providing solutions that improve speech and cognitive skills of DS children. To enhance the speech abilities, the proposed system offers a series of activities that require the child to speak out and spell out the words displayed on the screen. Furthermore, the mood of the child is also identified, and the child will be evaluated through an ML based weekly quiz to set difficulty levels. A set of oral motor exercises will also be offered by the system with the aim of enhancing oral motor skills of DS children. The exercises include tongue, lip, jaw, chewing and blowing exercises. Based on the child’s performance, personalized exercise plans will be created by the system. The system aims to improve cognitive skills of DS children by offering a set of learning activities that require the child to identify and memorize certain objects. Additionally, puzzle activity, IQ based questions and letter writing activity will be given to improve problem solving, thinking and mathematical skills. To enhance fine motor skills, a range of interactive games, puzzles, and tailored activities will be provided. Additionally, the system aims to receive support from therapists to achieve optimal results. All these activities offered by the system will be fun and engaging and it will encourage the child to participate more in the activities. The system will analyze the child’s performance throughout all the activities and provide meaningful insights to their caregivers and authorities.</P>

				  <p> Fig 4 illustrates the overall system diagram of the proposed solution which was intended to provide a smart approach for stakeholders, researchers, and Coconut Development Officers (CDOs) to detect the coconut diseases and pest infestations that may affect the coconut industry. As shown in the diagram, the registered users of the system can capture or upload the images which are suspicious. The images are sent to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) backend server where the flask server is deployed. These images are processed in the flask server by the designed DCNN models for disease identification. If WCLWD is found, the symptom severity will be determined using CNN models. Simultaneously, if CCI is identified, the images will go through the Mask-R-CNN model to determine the progression level while the number of caterpillars are extracted using the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm. Images will be classified using the CNN models of Mg deficiency and LSD at the same time.</p>
				  <p>Once the system identifies that the leaves are infected, then the response will be captured by the crowdsourcing platform. The Google Map will be updated with the real time locations (latitude and longitude) of the infected palms. In Addition, the system will automatically send notifications to the farmers and other stakeholders who are at the risk of infection.</p>
